# Complexity and Gouvernance

## Problem statement: Scale of complexity.

All computer science papers start with some reference to Moore’s law [[MOORE](#108e8367b470424ab6a374c4b3ae24c5)]. Computing, and the complexity of the machines that we surround ourselves with (physical, and now-days virtual), communication and modern logistics have enormously complicated our world: first the interconnectivity and inter-dependence of different parts of our lives, and second the speed at which decisions must be made. This, compounded with our increasing population yields complexity that magnifies the already exponential growth of Moore's law. The assertion here is that our single biggest issue, as a population, is managing scale and complexity within decision making.

## Complexity

Defining and measuring Complexity is hard. While many have tried, the results are mixed, and typically 'proxies' for complexity have to be used. An overview is provided by [[TURCHIN]](#2d7f858574b24b1b95e9917ef1bd9434). What is clear is how complexity current decisions are, for instance, those associated with climate change, see [[HERNANDEZ]](#17fb5873ab6f4951aed49d74527a7f8f).

Complexity in decisions is hard to handle. One approach is to have a hierarchical management structure, in which (theoretically) decisions at higher levels of a hierarchy are simplified sufficiently. This approach is preferred by business organisations, (though more recently augmented by a 'matrix' organisational structures that permit parallel hierarchies) [[BIZORG]](#c9fbd2b6ad01437cb533970353feb1c8).  The difficulty with this approach is the interplay between different parts of the decision tree can only be dealt with at higher managerial levels. In order to resolve a decision that may be relatively simple, but needs contributions from two different parts of an organisation, requires that the issue and information is propagated up to a managerial level that covers both. This is so called “silo” mentality in business [[MOHAPELOA]](#10b93d9f6ef040969acf816fbcbd03a1).  As complexity increases, the interconnectivity of different issues will also increase, the expectation is that the frequency of cross 'silo' issues will also increase. Within a business context, cross-silo working is, of course, critical to productivity [[GULATI]](#45791226ffd24b21a4af814454dacdc3).

The business imperative to work across silos, and to include a matrix managerial structure, can be viewed as a more heterachical system, involving a wider group of participants from across the business in decision making. The same can be said for many ‘liberal democracies’ in that a collection of people from across the state are elected, and come together to make decisions. In principle these individuals are not necessarily part of a 'silo'. In practise (of course) they most certainly are, as typically they are only elected because of their allegiance to one or other political grouping. Additionally, the decision making body is is often ‘augmented’ by a final ‘executive’ layer who provide the singleton ‘Leviathanesque’ point of control [[HOBBES]](#17aaf8d3fbe74489ad495cc3994d141e).

The institutions we have that deal with decision making (parliaments, senates, politburo, etc) have largely remained the same. The United Kingdom parliament first sat in 1801. During the first decades 1801-1819 parliament passed about 150 acts per year while between 2000 and 2019 about 37 acts were passed per year. (see [[UKACTS]](#3167459239a04207b22c6ae9cedf6d6a) ). The number of acts clearly has not kept up with an increase in complexity, but it may be that the complexity of the decisions leading to the act cause the number of acts to reduce, as the number of 'sitting days' for the UK parliament has stayed relatively  stable since at least the 1940's (see [[UKSITTING]](#f248436dbc704a4fa841754bf15f434f) ).

The difficulty is that the executive has to assimilate all the information, and form decisions across the breadth of the organisation of the state. As complexity increases, this becomes difficult, but that difficulty is exacerbated by the increased visibility they are given in our increasingly socially connected world. Not only do they now have to take these decisions, they must do so quickly, and potentially in front of the population at large. While the wider understanding of the parliamentary body could be used to inform and assist in such decisions, the partisan nature of debate, and the way in which the executive alone is seen to be responsible and is held in the public eye undermines that role.

In a hierarchical structure, additional complexity could be handled, to some degree, by adding additional layers in the hierarchy. This is not an idea solution, requires extra 'matrix' and 'cross silo' structures; none the less, it could be argued that such a structure could, in the end, scale to meet complexity.

The 'civil service', in contrast to the essentially 'flat' nature of of political structures is typically hierarchical, and has indeed grown, especially in times when decision making is critical (such as the world wars) [[UKCIVIL]](#1a2e5138cf644fd9abda603709d53483). Its role, to advise and implement, reduces the 'decision making load'. However, since the 1950s, the political imperative has been to shrink the size of 'the state', and primarily the civil service. This, again, compounds the difficulty of decision making for the executive.

Presented with this perfect storm few state leaders show the aptitude to be able to process such wide sources of information, and those that do are often considered ‘alien’ from their population. President Macron is a case in point. Clearly able to hold public meetings on wide ranging topics for hours on end, addressing each topic in amazing detail [[MACRON]](#60dd0d561917472f86d567ec4db9ad58), he has alienated the population at large who consider him 'elite' [[ELITE]](#44f6f000cd5647bfa6b51e87f7bac0aa).  The (popularise) alternative  seems to be to ignore the detail, and "go with your gut". In their history of decision making, Buchanan and O'Connell term it the "romance of the gut".  It is, of course, all to easy to criticise this approach (For review see [[BONABEAU]](#d4ab108ae4a341b8bfc5794c15229ecf)), but in a Hobbesian political structure, it is crucially important that a central decision is made. It is the very basis of a Hobbesian state, it is also what underpins the Confucian philosophy of a moral authority of rulers [[WONG]](#945a388a2e814c53823c9e2c16b7fc37). None the less, poor decisions have consequences. Maintaining the authority to rule invariably means making reasonable decisions. 

> As complexity increases, the structures we have are increasingly inappropriate and unfit for purpose.

Of course, one response, a libertarian response,  would be simply to make fewer decisions. While this reduces the number of decisions, there rest some decisions that are needed (for instance those that protect liberty). As the complexity of the world increases, the number of those decisions and their complexity will also increase. Removing decisions can do no more than delay the point in time when our existing political structures are overstretched.

The decisions which are taken, and how that is influenced is an important issue and addressed later in this paper. 

Returning to Moores law, computing is a domain that has learnt to handle complexity. Not only have the number of transistors increased roughly in line with Moores original prediction that it will double ever two years, the number of instructions that computers are able to perform every second follows much the same curve, as does (by extension) the number of 'decisions' (branches) a computer can make [[IPS](#7da74afa82e14f88a7ad77881a8211cc)]. While semiconductor manufacturing processes have been improved, and the size of chips has increased, they key to this growth is 'parallelism'. Not only does the hardware inside a computer itself work 'in parallel' for instance processing many different aspects of an instruction at the same time, but software now relies on being able to run different parts of the software at the same time in order to achieve high performance. Today, as computers are increasingly connected, and "algorithms" are increasingly distributed, the complexity is staggering (e.g 2.43×$10^{18}$ provided by Folding@home distributed computing system during COVID-19 pandemic response [[FLOPS](#b9614340d9b14ca8992dac16b7574916)])

Parallelism in decision making would enable our processes to deal with complexity. However, to engineer parallelism requires an understanding of the decision making process, and the dependencies within that process.

## Dividing the problem space

Building on the premises that complexity is the problem, parallelism would seem to be a 'generic' solution. However, as  Hobbes [[HOBBES](#17aaf8d3fbe74489ad495cc3994d141e)] pointed out, when a decision is required, it must be consistently applied, and that (typically) implies a singularity. For parallelism, this is a limitation.

Historically decisions could be applied to geographic areas, and potentially different geographic areas could have different rules. The absurdity of this approach globally can be seen during the covid-19 pandemic [[COVID](#66c883da3b6442a7a360a513415e00d1)]. While there are issues that affect individuals in a geographically limited area, there are clearly issues which are non geographic. Indeed it is hard to find an example of an issue which would strictly match existing state level boundaries except for historic reasons. How many an issues are there which must be decided within France that are not applicable, or would have a different optimum solution in Germany? Making the same decision twice simply doubles the number of decisions required, stressing an already limited decision making resource.

If decision making can't be divided geographically, and even when it is it doesn't help reduce the number of decisions required, then the question is how to divide decision making in such a way that the process can be parallelised.

The powers of  states are typically divided between branches of government. The tripartite system [[TRI](#edd76e52186641fba7d5049442bc6c2e)] ascribed to Baron de Montesquieu divides power between a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary. However, "power" in this context is wider than the power to decide, it is also the coercive power to enforce the decision (and the executive power to implement the decisions).  While this distinction is important and meaningful, in itself it does not reduce the complexity of the decision making itself. Montesquieu also distinguished between international and civil legislature. This does 'divide' issues and allows for (two fold) parallelism, but at the cost of 'silos' where international and civil law interact (which, today, is almost everywhere as we live in an increasingly globalised world).

Before looking at the decision making process, it is important to state, decision making, in the context of a state, is less about correct and incorrect decisions, and more about mediating between several alternatives [[FULLER](#ebc425911903469e80df8c60080cb004)]. Hence the purpose of a decision making process should not aim for a definitive 'right' answer, rather it should be designed to find answers that are acceptable to all.

The decision making process can be broken down into 3 different questions:

1. Which decisions are needed, and in which order?
2. Where (and How) should those decisions be made (or by whom)?
3. What should the decision be?

Most attempts to address this issue seem to ‘mix’ these 3 issues. Hobbes combined them all into his Leviathan.  Often the same state actors decide both the “Which” and “What” clauses, and often decisions about the “Where” are answered by a combination of geography and history. Hence in the UK, parliament is sovereign and has the power to decide on all issues. It devolves some issues geographically to 3 nations, and others to lower levels of regional governance. The distribution of decision making is strictly geographic, and remains relatively constant over time (it is not decided on a case-by-case basis) [[DEVO](#937154d373ac4954850304af68132bd9)].

In a Hobbesian state, not all decisions need to be taken by the state, but, as Constants [[CONSTANTS](#5701a8f8fb9c4ac2b8e3ada2630e0618)] point out there is a peril in not taking an interest in the decisions that will be taken. It is the 'Which' clause over which the public must be vigilant. It is the authority that the state assumes to make decisions. Controlling which decisions are made is critical in order to protect the individual against the state exerting too much power. In many liberal democracies, the public may vote on a manifesto, assuming that the issues mentioned within it are the only ones that will be decided upon. However, in reality, the sovereignty to decide 'which' decisions are needed resides in the 'executive' branch of government.  A stricter separation of this power would better curtail the power of the state; this is not to prevent rapid decisions making when its needed, simply that the same body should not be responsible for recognising the need for a decision as that that forms the decision itself.

However, separation of all three clauses is not strictly required. The “Which” and “Where” may be combined but they should be strictly isolated from the “What”. Discovery of issues, and isolating who would be best suited to address them is a very different activity from the decision making process itself.
Issues that need addressing may be distributed geographically, demographically, in different economic segments, or (more likely) a combination of all these. ‘Finding’ the problem, and determining whether the state should indeed 'interfere' in it, understanding its impact, prioritising it, and identifying between which parties mediation is necessary and who would be best placed to address the issue, in itself, is complex. 

In conclusion, two different processes are required, one which ascertains what decisions should be made, and by whom, and one that makes the decisions.

The interesting conclusion here is not the primary devision of labor, rather the possibility that the initial question "what, and by whom" will result in a multitude of different, potentially overlapping, non-geographic "bodies". It will be these that enable the massive parallelism and scale that is required to address complexity. But this has a very deep and far reaching consequence, sovereignty no long rests with a single entity, rather it is distributed between a multitude of disparate bodies, each addressing specific (or at least related) issues.

This requires a system capable of not only discovering issues, but understanding them sufficiently to be able to allocate them to suitable decision making bodies, combined with the acceptance of a distributed sovereignty. The potential benefit is a system the scales with complexity.

## Tools for decision making.

This analysis provides a potential parallelism that could be exploited to manage complexity. However it relies upon several different types of decision making.  Firstly the issues that are important to a population must be established. This is critical both to determine the salient issues, but equally to protect individuals against the over zealous state. Second these issues have to be analysed sufficiently to understand the form of the body which would be best suited to address them. Finally, of course, a suitable body must be formed and needs to make the decision.

Each of these three processes requires careful construction, with sufficient checks and balances to ensure that not only is the function fulfilled, but it is done so in a transparently honest manner, not favouring or disenfranchising any particular part of society. Of course, as [[MacKinnon](#9234fd8734f14ff29b213e98a4b76402)] has pointed out, not disenfranchising one part of society, or favouring another, is not always easy to organise. The built in bias in society needs to be taken into account. Leaving the choice of decision makers to that biased society will invariably lead to a biased result. The issue is, of course, that the bias can be invisible to all members of the society including (potentially) those who are disadvantaged by the bias. 

Hence the tools required must be deliberately chosen, and chosen to guard against malpractice and, as far as is possible, bias. One answer to both issues is to increase sample sizes, or the number of participants to a decision. As that number increases, the risk of malpractice diminishes. As [[LANGE](#a2269472bbc04350bd8f3103b1d672f3)] points out, the perpencty to be corrupt increases with familiarity. As group sizes grow, the ability to be 'familiar' with the entire group diminishes. 

Equally, while bias may be present in the population at large at least a larger sample size may include members that dont exhibit the bias, bringing forward views and opinions that may convince others.

[[BURCA](#e646174927b8487ebfae6060b328ae1f)] proposes a tool for decision making termed Global Experimentalist Governance (GXG). 

> GXG is an institutionalised process of participatory and multilevel collective problem solving, where the problems and the means of addressing them are framed in an open-ended way, and subjected to periodic revision by various forms of peer review in the light of locally generated knowledge.

Not only does GXG provide a framework for problem solving, it also, specifically, proposes a way to further sub-divide the issue. In the analysis we propose here, the choice to use this methodology would be the outcome of a decision about Where and How a decision should be made. It may not be appropriate for all decisions, but it guides and informs in terms of a process which emphasises that the 'Where' is not singular in itself. GXG specifically recognises that the best solution for an issue may vary across locations, and that the expertise needed to find that solution may be locally based as well as more globally. This allows a "Where" choice which encompasses both global and local participation.

While "locality" is often treated geographically, it is also beneficial to consider non geographic problem dissections. The danger in dissecting a problem (geographically or otherwise) is that If it is ‘framed’ as solve-able by a specific set of sub-devisions, then, that dissection of the problem has already excluded some solutions. Aspects of the problem (or geographic areas) that fall outside of the scope of the sub-devisions are excluded from the potential solution. One clear case of this is "global" decision making pushing unpalatable decisions down to sub-jurisdictions, while failing to fix the systemic issue at the global level.  It is therefore critical that both global and local solutions are considered, and that the "Where and How" decisions are carefully considered before entering into the GXG process.

GXG also emphasises the need for monitoring and feedback. This is  critical for all forms of decision making, but has specific problems for typical 'participatory' mechanisms such as 'Citizen Juries', as typically those bodies are expected to be temporary.  The GXG framework helps to ensure that the long-term monitoring and the consequences of that monitoring are considered by a decision making body. It must equally be explicitly defined what the results of that monitoring should be (recall of the body to adjust the implemented solution, construction of a new body, etc).

## Which decisions should be addressed:

Within the framework of determining which decisions are needed, by whom, how and with which outcomes, the critical 'defence' that the public has against the state is to prevent the state making rules which unduly interfere with the lives of the citizens.  

> Which decisions are taken by the state critically influences the lives of citizens, and universal influence over that must be central to governance.

A system that propagates problems through a hierarchy risks isolating issues within ’silos’ -  the hierarchy, as established, will greatly influence the issues that are discovered. 

An alternative approach is a more heterarchical ’sampling’. In order to 'discover' issues that are pertinent to a society this could, and should take a very large sample size. A large sample covers the various combinations of geography, demography, economic segments, etc and  can also ensure against bias and corruption. 

But managing a large sample size can be problematic, it is hard to determine the importance of issues which may directly effect only a few people, while having much wider implications.

The only viable solution is a more anarchistic hybrid: Sampling, hierarchies, and mass participation (potentially via 'digital democracy') all have their places.  Citizens should have the right to submit issues and ideas, directly, to the state, and all such ideas should be considered on their merit.

This leaves a ‘mass’ of ungraded and potentially miss-understood issues and ideas. Some may have gained public popularity, others may be ‘hidden’. In all cases they need to be understood, from the perspective of how important they are, and who should make  decisions about them. For issues to be worth-while addressing, they will necessarily be complex, even this level of analysis takes time.

Given the breadth and complexity of issues, the assertion is that neither one individual, nor ‘everybody’ can deal with all issues. This isn’t a university held view. As we have seen, engagement with the state is almost a prerequisite of "liberal democracy" ([[CONSTANTS](#5701a8f8fb9c4ac2b8e3ada2630e0618)], [[FULLER](#ebc425911903469e80df8c60080cb004)])), but, given the complexity of the world today, an individual is unable to engage with all issues to a level where they can even establish how important they are to their own life. Should one worry about a pandemic, or a comet hitting the earth, financing 5g networks or developing electric motors. They are all ‘important’, they may also directly affect our lives. Hence the axiom that an individual can sensibly engage and contribute to  debate on all issues, or even just those most important to them, is refuted. This isn't about the ability of the individual, nor a lack of education, nor a concern about outcome, it is purely a reflection of increased complexity. Ignoring complexity is to ignore some issues in preference to "more important" issues (which itself requires an ordering), or to (overly) simplify issues.

If, in general, individuals are incapable of engaging on even all the issues that are (unbeknown or not) important to them, by extension, no one individual could understand all issues on behalf of every other individual. Neither the approach of a single leader, nor of 'global suffrage' on all issues, can work.
A solution to this is a ‘mini-public’  to be used as a ‘proxy’ for the individuals best wishes. Decisions taken by the many are more likely to be right than decisions taken by the few [[LANDSDOWN](#f0df675f79dc48039dc48bfeaa950216)]. However, an individual will only be happy to support this proxy if they believe that it will come to decisions that reflect their own beliefs (which may be more or less altruistic). This is examined below, it is critical.

Assuming such a ‘mini-public’, such a body should study individual issues, focusing on understanding the scope, who (or what) require mediation, and ‘who' would be best placed to answer the problem.

To summarise : Issues should be collected universally, but their analysis in terms of which bodies should address the issues should be performed by citizens themselves. 

This could be done by a permanent 'civil service', an elected body, or mini-publics. Out of all the options, the 'mini-public' scales easily, could be used to minimise corruption and bias, and increase the number of citizens involved in the governmental process. 

'Mini publics' used for this task will be referred as the governance mini public.

There is an advantage of ’scale’ : resources also scale. If issues can be processed in parallel, the importance of relative ‘priorities’ can be reduced as the issues no longer have to be serialised through a single decision making body. Multiple mini-publics can co-exists simultaneously. Hence the key issue for an individual ‘mini public’ is to ascertain which decision making body would be needed to address an issue, and whether the issue must be addressed by the same body as another decision (in which case, what the priority should be). This should significantly reduce the ‘complexity’ of a mini-public. The outcome of such a governance mini-public should indicate the make up (geographic, demographic, economic) of a decision making body, and the scope of the issue. The proposed decision making body may already exist, or may be unique to the issue. It may be geographically constrained, or global. The role of the gouvernance mini-public is to identify the make up of a decision making body that would be suitable to make a suitable decision. The scope may be complex including who or what issues need mediating, those that are knowledgable in the field, related issues (including budgetary issues), etc. This mini-public would not have any decision making powers, the separation of the analysis of the problem from the decision making body itself is critical. It is also critical that both are in the hands of citizens. Failure to do so can lead perfectly reasonable decision making bodies to be so constrained that their results are totally predictable: The recent Convention Citoyenne in France ([[CITCONV](#afe74a2dd58e4286b9e89de5b4bd4905)]) was convened to address the issues of climate control. The initial scope, given by President Macron, was wide, nothing was off limits. However, the organisation of the convention split the issue of climate into 5 specific themes (from the second session onwards). The themes were food, work, housing, commerce and travel. Clearly setting the frame in which the question is addressed to these 5 themes excludes (for instance) economic or governmental reform as a possible subject. We can only speculate whether this was due to a lack of awareness of the wider issues in the governance group, or a specific (and presumably political) restriction given to the convention. This lack of transparency, and the resulting restriction in the workings of what ended up being a very dedicated deliberative decisions making body, clearly highlights the need for the scope of decisions to itself be the matter of deliberative and public debate.

### Representativity of Mini-publics:

The goal of a mini-public is to form a decision ‘optimal’ for the public at large. I, as an individual, must believe that the mini-public will take into account my needs as much as anybody else’s in order for me to support and trust such a body.

There are, perhaps, two ways to ‘find’ such an optimal solution. Either the mini-public is vast enough to contain, in itself, enough expertises to address the problem; or the mini-public is relatively small, but ‘learns’ from experts about potential solutions.

Expertise can come in many forms, for example :

- Technical experts: Individuals 'validated' by society at large, e.g. academic accolades etc.
- Vocational experts; people who have experience within a particular sector or line of work
- Representative Individuals and witnesses: people with direct experience of an issue.

In the case of the governance mini publics addressing the relative importance of issues, and determining the makeup and structure of a decision making body that will ultimately mediate the issue, apart from the initial proposer of an issue (potentially an individual), there is no pre-defined list of 'experts' to call upon. The members of the mini-public themselves will have to research the issues. They are, effectively, working on behalf of the population at large, not to resolve an issue, but to discover all the information that may be important. Critically deciding if the issues should be resolved by the state, and if so, by whom. In terms of the French Convention Citoyenne, they are effectively the governance committee. It is their responsibility to ensure that issues of economy are dealt with (or not). Their deliberations should be public and transparent. This requires a huge amount of effort (and a little skill) in terms of researching a topic. I dont doubt that this is a hard task, but we should not underestimate the intelligence and ability of our fellow citizens. Clearly, the governance mini public must be large enough not only to be representative of the population at large, but also large enough that the research work can be distributed enough to make it manageable.

Finding the experts is hard work, and requires knowledge that is potentially sparse in the community. Relying on a ‘civil service’ simply pushes away the problem, and there is no reason to believe that a civil service would have more knowledge than a mini public. 

It is the wider public who know who the experts are. This is also a place for mass participation including ‘digital democracy’.  Suggesting, and indeed ‘promoting’ and ‘voting for’ 'expertise' is, something that the public at large takes part in today on many digital platforms. As participants in our democracy, we all listen to and cast judgement on 'expertise'. Allowing mass participation in this activity captures that wider knowledge. The governance mini public is there to collect and collate those experts, mediate the wider populations views, and ultimately decide which 'experts' will be presented to a citizens assembly <<<*** explain.

The second possible use of a mini public is as a decision making body itself. Trust in such a body is clearly even more important.

In this case, assuming that 'optimal solutions' will somehow emerge from a limited body seems unlikely.  Without significant input, the 'expertise' necessary to resolve an issue would be expected to 'emerge' from the decision making body.  In 1800's, when the UK parliament was formed, a single body of limited size, 658 (white men) seemed to suffice, and cover enough expertise in itself. Without additional inputs (for instance select committees, in their current form since the 1960s), the UK parliament would not have the expertise it needs. Neither would, even a large, 'mini-public'.

The experts that are brought before a mini-public are clearly critical to its working. Effectively the participants are also judging the quality of the information that is being put before them, they are operating like a 'Citizens Jury' [[CROSBY](#0361df1987fd4268a05aa16ee08ff3b0)].

## What is decided

To form decisions, the proposal is to use a 'Citizens Jury' structure. There needs to be multiple citizens juries, in order to cover all issues and to scale. Those citizens juries, themselves, are unable to set their own agenda’s or to assess and choose the experts. That is the prerogative of the governance mini public. 

The form of the citizens jury, its size and composition should be left to the citizens of the governance mini public. They have studied the issue and understand who would be best able to decide upon a resolution.

Of course, this does bestow significant power on the governance mini public, but they are, just like a citizens jury, in the end, nothing more or less than a representative body of the public at large. One would have to imagine, just like in a jury trial, significant (and potentially malicious) bias in the mini-public, and in the citizens jury, to unduly influence the result.

Widespread social bias does exist ([[MACKINNON](#9234fd8734f14ff29b213e98a4b76402)]), but this process does, at the very least, ensure representativity. It also provides the opportunity for governance mini publics to choose citizens juries that are appropriately chosen to attempt to avoid such bias.

There is qualitative evidence that implies a huge amount of commitment to the process [[IRISH](#3ff4c294cd7049bfa91ed50c798ca541)], and others have found that participants  quickly become more knowledgable than elected officials [[TESTART](#29c38cc5913f4807a6e0849aefafa60a)]. There is every reason to believe mini publics and citizens juries would work hard on behalf of all citizens to mediate problems in an unbiased way.

The key difference here between a mini public, or a citizens jury is that the participants have time to investigate (in depth) a topic. The hundreds of bills a typical parliament passes each year means that each one can have little of the parliamentarians time. The ability to 'scale' the deliberation and decision making processes allows more time to consider the details of an issue.

Hence it is absolutely critical that citizens who are engaged on a specific mini public or citizens jury do so exclusively. This has financial as well as logistic consequences. As a society, having a more distributed decision making system may cost us financially, that seems a reasonable price to pay to ensure that potentially existential threats are properly examined ! It also precludes "politicians" who take part in many debates simultaneously. 

## Disseminating  the decision

Decisions, in order to be effective not only have to be made coherently, but there has to be acceptance of the decision and adhesion to it. Acceptance can come from coercion and force, but in many cases it is better that it comes from understanding and agreement. Lack of that agreement could, of course, lead to future tension and non adherence to the decision. 

But gaining that understanding is potentially hard. We often 'short-cut' that process by relying on 'trust'. The trust may come through authority, or experience. Trust is incredibly important in how individuals behave, and whether they follow governmental decisions, as highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic [[COVIDTRUST](#b37a1603a87b48b1ad3ef0f1d9c5c4e3)]. 

Hence if the population at large trusts the system of government, they will likely accept the decisions made. Poor communication of the decision and, indeed, the reasons behind the decisions, would, of course, reduce that trust.

One option to increase trust in the decision making body, and the decisions that it makes could be to include, in the decision making body people who are already widely 'trusted'.  This would help both disseminate the decision, but also ensure that the decision was trusted.

One option here would be to allow a certain number of 'trusted' individuals within an otherwise sortition based body. This would be a 'hybrid' semi-elected, semi-selected body.  More research into this may be required. Potentially using 'digital democracy' to find 'trusted individuals' for specific topics. However, in the end, the form of the decision making body should be decided by the governance mini public, and need not be pre-determined.

# Summary

Complexity of decision making underlies the collapse of our existing demographic systems. Attempting to handle that complexity alienates the public, while ignoring it leads to leadership that, while popularise, can be dangerous. 

While the underlying principle remains Hobbesian, in order to address complexity requires allowing for distributed sovereignty. 

Decision making itself should also be divided, between identifying what decisions, who should make them, and which decision is made. Influencing what decisions are made is critical constraint on the state, protecting citizens rights, and that influence should be available to all citizens.

Using a combination of mini-publics, digital democracy and citizens juries, the general principles of decision making can be implemented in a way that allows a high degree of parallelism, and hence scales to handle complexity.

When a work group is very small and face-to-face communication is frequent, formal structure may be unnecessary, but in a larger organization decisions have to be made about the delegation of various tasks.<br/><img height=10em src="https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/favicon.ico"> https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/management/Ob-Or/Organizational-Structure.html||
